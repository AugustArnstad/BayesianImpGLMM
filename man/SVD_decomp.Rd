\title{Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Scaling}
\usage{
SVD_decomp(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A data frame or matrix with numeric and possibly non-numeric columns.}
}
\value{
A list containing the SVD-transformed matrix `Z`, the rotation matrix `R`,
        and the scaling factors `lambda`.
}
\description{
This function performs a singular value decomposition (SVD) on a numeric matrix and scales the data.
Non-numeric columns are converted to numeric values by treating factors and characters appropriately.
}
\examples{
data(mtcars)
result <- SVD_decomp(mtcars)
}
